This framework contains a class for pixelating images. Takes an input image, processes it based on several properties, and produces an output image.

Properties include the shape of the resulting pixels and background shown between pixels. You may notice typedefs indicating future features- feel free to implement these or wait for me to get around to it.

This is all licensed under GPLv3 but you can contact me for other licensing terms if you require a different license.

Enjoy!
